    "Recursion can be a difficult concept to grasp at first, but it's a very rewarding and fun tool once understand it. Recursion is a method of repeating code without using loops. It usually takes the form of a function that calls itself during its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic mechanism has given rise to many interesting algorithms. Recursive algorithms often seem lazy when we write them, and can appear magical when they work. It's important to understand recursion so we can think about problems in new ways and write satisfying code that performs logic succinctly."

    "When we call factorial with 0 as its input, we want to simply return 1. This may seem a bit odd, but mathematically, 0! is defined as 1. We don't have to worry much about why this is; we'll just accept the definition and use it in our recursion. 1! still evaluates to 1 * (0!), which is 1.\n",
