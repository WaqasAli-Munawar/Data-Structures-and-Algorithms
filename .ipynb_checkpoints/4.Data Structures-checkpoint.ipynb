They store the first element of an array right next to the second element, which is next to the third, and so on. Each element in an array occupies a slot in that array. So, in an array of 10 elements, we can say definitively which item is in the first slot, the second slot, etc.\n",

Another simplifying assumption that follows is that insertion into our 2D arrays simply replaces whatever element was there, and that deletion leaves an \"empty\" slot in the array.\n",

When we want to access the population of New York later on, it does exactly the same thing: computes the index, and retrieves the population.\n",
